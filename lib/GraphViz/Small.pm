GraphViz::Small - subclass of GraphViz with small nodes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use GraphViz::Small;

  my $g = GraphViz::Small->new();
  # methods as for GraphViz

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Graphs produced by GraphViz are occasionally huge, making it hard to
observe the structure. This subclass simply makes the nodes small and
empty, allowing the structure to stand out.

=head1 METHODS

As for GraphViz.
