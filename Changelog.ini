Comments= <<EOT
- No changes from V 2.24.
- Update version # so as to release another version to CPAN which does not allow
identical version #s to be uploaded.
- The point is that I deleted GraphViz from CPAN, but some people still want to use it.
So, to everybody concerned, my apologies.
- Add t/00.versions.t and t/00.versions.tx to report all module versions during testing.

Date=2016-12-27T10:58:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Test with Test::More V 1.001002 rather than V 1.302019, and all tests still pass.
See RT#115236. Thanx to Kent Fredric for again (sorry!) prompting me over this.
Lowering the version of Test::More in Makefile.PL is the only change in this version.

- Add no_xxe to XML::Twig instantiation. See RT#118972. Many thanx to Lisa Hare for a

[V 2.22]
Date=2016-07-19T09:24:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Revert change so we use Test::More instead of Test2::Bundle::Extended.
See RT#115236. Thanx to ribasushi for this report, and my apologies for not acting sooner.

[V 2.21]

[V 2.20]
Date=2015-12-29T08:13:00
Comments=- Merge patch from ntyni via github. This concerned use of defined(@some_array). With thanx.

[V 2.19]
Date=2015-11-13T08:30:00
Comments= <<EOT
- No code changes.
- Accept pull request from Patrice Clement to add the x_deprecated flag to both META.json and
META.yml. The docs already had various references to 'deprecated', including directing users
to GraphViz2, so no change is needed there. Thanx Patrice.
- Add .gitignore to MANIFEST.SKIP.
EOT

[V 2.18]
Date=2015-05-28T08:43:00
Comments= <<EOT
- All patches to this version are from chrony, via a github pull request. With thanx.
- Use File::Which on Windows to detect if Graphviz is present.
- Clean up the code, including Build.PL and Makefile.PL.
EOT

[V 2.17]
Date=2015-03-30T08:56:00
Comments= <<EOT
- No code changes.
- Create github repo. This has been done because ribasushi (Peter Rabbitson) has kindly offered
some patches. Hence I've reversed my policy of encouraging this module to die :-).
- Update Build.PL and Makefile.PL to point to the repo. None of the pre-reqs were updated.
EOT

[V 2.16]
Date=2014-08-30T08:25:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Update docs on how to download AT&T's Graphviz.
Thanx to Alex Becker (see RT#98405).
EOT

[V 2.15]
Date=2013-11-28T11:23:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Fix double-quote escaping bug in GraphViz's _attributes() method. See RT#90528.
Many thanx to Smylers for the report.
- Rename CHANGES to Changes as per CPAN::Changes::Spec.
EOT

[V 2.14]
Date=2012-11-09T16:06:00
Comments= <<EOT
- No code changes.
- Patch t/foo.t to not assume text appears on specific lines of the output test files.
EOT

[V 2.13]
Date=2012-11-09T08:27:00
Comments= <<EOT
- No code changes.
- Re-package distro because users get errors during testing. See RT#80709.
Since I had this same error during my testing, I assume the uploaded version contains un-patched
code. The errors are not in GraphViz, they are in the test code which has hard-coded line numbers
where it looks for strings in the output. The output has been reformatted recently, and no longer
matches those assumptions. See t/foo.t for details. Note: I did not write those tests :-).
EOT

[V 2.12]
Date=2012-11-08T12:38:00
Comments= <<EOT
- No code changes.
- For pre-reqs such as strict, warnings, etc, which ship with Perl, set the version # to 0.
Reported as RT#80663 by Father Chrysostomos for Tree::DAG_Node.
EOT

[V 2.11]
Date=2012-09-18T08:22:00
Comments=- Add VDX as an output format.

[V 2.10]
Date=2012-03-26T10:11:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Accept a patch kindly supplied by Alexander Kriegisch, to change handling of the rankdir attribute.
The valid values are BT, LR, RL or TB, or their lower-case equivalents.
Previously, only a true value was accepted, which meant LR. Now, any value not in that list defaults to LR.
Files changed: README, CHANGES, Changelog.ini, GraphViz.pm, GraphViz/Regex.pm and simple.t.
- Patch this file to replace BST with GMT, since both DateTime::Format::HTTP and DateTime::Format::Strptime
fail to recognize BST.
These modules are used by Module::Metadata::Changes to transform this file into Changelog.ini.
EOT

[V 2.09]
Date=2011-12-15T11:08:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Adopt Flavio Poletti's suggestion of trying to pipe to dot, in Build.PL/Makefile.PL, rather than using File::Which,
to see if dot (Graphviz) is installed. This (hopefully) solves the problem of using File::Which on systems where it is
not installed, before Build.PL/Makefile.PL has a chance to tell the user that File::Which is required. See: RT#73077.
EOT

[V 2.08]
Date=2011-11-01T10:55:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Wind back pre-reqs for various modules to match what was shipped with Perl V 5.8.1.
Many thanx to Brian Cassidy for the error report: https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=72068.
EOT

[V 2.07]
Date=2011-10-30T16:08:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Rewrite Build.PL and Makefile.PL to try loading File::Which rather than assuming it is installed.
This avoids the chicken-and-egg problem whereby these 2 programs need File::Which::which to find 'dot'.
Many thanx to Richard Clamp for the error report: https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=71971.
EOT

[V 2.06]
Date=2011-10-25T08:09:00

- Ensure all modules contain a version number.
- Update the docs regarding the list of modules shipped in this distro.

Comments= <<EOT
- thanks to Ron Savage, patched to work under systems
which have an executable extension, such as Windows
EOT

Date=2004-08-24T15:30:31
Comments= <<EOT

EOT

[V 1.4]
Date=2001-10-03T07:57:42
Comments= <<EOT
- added new filehandle, scalar reference, and code reference
scheme to as_* to allow streaming of data, rather than
accumulating potentially very large output in memory (based
on patch by Dave Rolsky)
- new pagewidth and pageheight graph attributes for creating
PostScript mosaics of large graphs (idea by Nelson Loyola)

Devel::GraphVizProf
